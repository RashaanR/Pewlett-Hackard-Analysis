# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of the analysis is to help Bobby's manager be better prepared for the "Silver tsunami" which is the 
event is where many of the older employees will start retiring. Bobby's manager wants to start a program where the
older employees can become mentors to the newer ones before they completly retire. To do that we found the number
of employees retiring by title and the ones who will be eligible for the mentor program. 

## Results

Some things to point out:
1. There are 6 managers total an two of them are going to retirement elgible soon, what are the parameters for becoming an manager
since there are so many employees and senior postions already in place?

2. There are 272 senior engineers about to be retirement eligible. Even if they all agree to be a mentor instead of flat out retiring,
how would we split up 272 part time mentors amongst the other 9285 regular engineers?

3. There are 60 assistant engineers that will be ready for retirement soon. Will they be elgible for the mentorship program? Even though
they didnt obtain a senior role in some sort?

4. Technique leaders seem to be in a class of their own? Who would they mentoring when the "Silver tsunami" takes place?

## Summary

There are about 1549 roles that will have to filled if the "Silver tsunami" took full effect. Which is not a bad amount compared to the current
amount of employeers we have. I would suggest taking a look a what specificage demographic to focus on with the mentorship program, but looking at 
results from the quary outline down below. We can see that nobody born after 1965 has been hired which is pretty alarming. Young people are
innovative and the future!
